# Quyx Examples

## Structure

-   Each example project folders should be individually clone-able
-   Each example project has to include a `README.md` in its root which needs to contain:
    -   name of the example
    -   description of the example
    -   which technologies it uses _outside of_ the quyx libraries
    -   what quyx libraries methods are utilized in the example
    -   how to run the example project locally after cloning
