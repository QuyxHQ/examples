# directory

This is a sample implementation of Quyx using `@quyx/ts` - for the backend and `@quyx/ui-react` - for the frontend

It tries to show how the issuing of credentials, permitting a space to access a credential, revoking a space access to a credential or even revoking the credential itself works and how it helps you control your data yourself
